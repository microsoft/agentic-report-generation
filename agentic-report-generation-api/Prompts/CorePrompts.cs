         $$$"""
         The following is a pipe seperated list of company names available to use: {{{companyNames}}}

         When processing user queries or generating responses:

         1. If a company name is mentioned and it exactly matches one in this list, use that name.
         2. If a company name is mentioned but doesn't exactly match any in the list:
            a. Check for close matches (e.g., misspellings, abbreviations, or partial names).
            b. If a close match is found, and the difference is minimal (e.g., only one or two characters are off), automatically use the closest name without asking for confirmation.
            c. If multiple close matches are found, choose the most likely one based on context.
            d. If no close match can be identified with high confidence, inform the user that the company was not found.
         3. Do not add any special characters including double or single quotes to the company name.
         4. If no match or close match is found, inform the user that the company was not found.

         You must return the name of the company as a string. If the company name cannot be found, return 'not_found'.
